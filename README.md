# ðŸš€ Tech Interview Challenges

A collection of coding challenges and solutions commonly encountered by me in technical interviews. Each solution includes multiple approaches with detailed complexity analysis and explanations.

## ðŸ“‹ Challenge List

| Challenge | Language | Difficulty | Topics |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------|
| [Two Sum](#two-sum) | PHP | Easy | Arrays, Hash Tables |
| [Lowest Common Ancestor](#lowest-common-ancestor) | PHP | Medium | Trees, Binary Trees |

## ðŸ“Š Complexity Analysis

Each solution includes detailed Big O analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** How runtime scales with input size
- **Space Complexity:** How memory usage scales with input size

## ðŸ“ˆ Complexity Comparison

| Challenge | Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Two Sum | Brute Force | O(nÂ²) | O(1) | Simple but inefficient |
| Two Sum | Hash Map | O(n) | O(n) | Optimal for large inputs |
| LCA | Optimal | O(h) | O(1) | Best approach with parent pointers |
| LCA | Array-based | O(h) | O(h) | Alternative with more memory usage |
